[Matt Gemmell][]'s ever-evolving ZMK keymap for the [Corne-ish Zen split keyboard][], designed for use with iPadOS. I've written about my various layouts [on my blog][]. It mirrors the [QMK layout for my Corne][], which is shown below.

## Features

- Mostly for writing (which is what I do)
- 4 layers in the usual Planck momentary setup
- Includes numpad, inverted-T cursors, mouse and scroll-wheel, media keys, and system shortcuts
- One-shot mods that can be carried between layers
- Autoshift enabled
- No tap-dance or combos
